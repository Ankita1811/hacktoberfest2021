Tower of Hanoi is a very old problem. People had been solving it for many years. In this problem, you have to shift disk from one peg to another peg 
using the third peg. Let me explain it more.

 Concept of recursion is being used in this problem otherwise the code will become super complex and hard to understand .
 The recursive solution is simple and easily understandable.
 
 In the parameters of this method I have provided the number of disks and source and destination and via a peg.
 
 -> void tower(int n, char source, char des, char via);
 
 Inside this method, we have two cases one is base and other is the recursive case. 
 In base case, we just print which ring is moving from which peg to which peg using some peg.
 
  
->  if(n == 1){
    cout << "Moved the ring "<< n << " from " << source << " to " << des << " via " << via << ".\n";
    }

In recursive case we use the method two times and in between them we print the message again
 
->   else{
      tower(n-1,source, via, des);
      cout << "Moved the ring " << n << " from " << source << " to " << des << " via " << via << ".\n";
      tower(n-1,via,des,source);
}

C++ code : 

#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;
 
void tower(int n, char source, char des, char via){
if(n == 1){
    cout << "Moved the ring "<< n << " from " << source << " to " << des << " via " << via << ".\n";
 
}
else{
    tower(n-1,source, via, des);
    cout << "Moved the ring " << n << " from " << source << " to " << des << " via " << via << ".\n";
    tower(n-1,via,des,source);
}
 
}
 
int main()
{
    int rings;
    char source='A';
    char des = 'B';
    char via = 'C';
    cout << "Enter the number of rings : "; 
    cin >> rings;
    tower(rings,source,des,via);
 
    return 0;
}



Expected Output : 

Enter the number of rings : 5
Moved the ring 1 from A to B via C.
Moved the ring 2 from A to C via B.
Moved the ring 1 from B to C via A.
Moved the ring 3 from A to B via C.
